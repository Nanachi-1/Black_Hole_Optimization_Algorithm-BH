# Welcome to Black Hole Optimization Algorithm (BH) Program
## Description
This is a simple example program in 2-D for solve problems by Black Hole Optimization Algorithm (BH).  
Where the variables in two dimensions are x1 and x2.  
## Technologies Used
This program needs python version 3 with random,numpy library
## Setting Program
**You can set the value in the set global variables section and the set objective function section.**  
- **Variable in the set global variables section**  
  
  - n = number of particles.  
  - iteration = number of iterations.  
  - Upper_x1 = Upper bound for finding the solution to variable x1.  
  - Upper_x2 = Upper bound for finding the solution to variable x2.  
  - Lower_x1 = Lower bound for finding the solution to variable x1.  
  - Lower_x2 = Lower bound for finding the solution to variable x2.  

- **Variable in the set objective function**
  - obj_point = The result of objective function ( You can set objective function here! )

## Test functions for optimization
**In this program, we use the himmelblau function but you can set it in the set objective function section.**  
The other test functions for optimization can be found at : [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization)

## Future Scope
In the future, we will be adding part of the diagram display and  other objective functions such as Ackley function, Cross-in-tray function
